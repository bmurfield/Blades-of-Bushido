# Blades-of-Bushido

## Description

A browser based 2 player fighting game

* I wanted to make a web application for an easy to play fighting game

* I added two sprite characters and then animated them with running, jumping and attacks.

* They also have death animations and the center of the screen displays who won.

* In this project I learned how to use HTML Canvas and the basics of JavaScript game development.
